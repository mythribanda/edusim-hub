===========
Centralized Educational Relationship Registry for EduSim.

This module acts as the authoritative central repository for educational relationship 
templates. It allows the simulation compiler, AI generator, and tutor layers to 
dynamically query, lookup, and compose relationships based on educational levels, 
physics concepts, or specific scenario demands.

It stores standard templates that are then hydrated/bound to concrete sandbox 
properties and object IDs by the `RelationshipBuilder`.

ARCHITECTURE & SCALABILITY
--------------------------
1. Unified Template Library: Pre-populates a dictionary of production-grade 
   `EducationalRelationship` templates mapped by their canonical IDs.
2. Tag-Based & Level-Based Queries: Exposes search utilities to easily filter 
   relationships (e.g., retrieving all 'energy_conservation' relationships for 
   'high_school' level).
3. Dynamic Custom Relationships: Supports runtime registration of novel relationships 
   without touching any static files, ensuring future unknown scenarios (like 
   quantum entanglement sandbox) are fully supported.
