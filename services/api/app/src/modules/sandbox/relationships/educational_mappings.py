=======================
Educational Mappings system for EduSim.

This module maps runtime physics concepts, tags, and properties to rich educational
metadata. It acts as the conceptual bridge between the raw physics parameters (like 
velocity, tension, thrust) and their pedagogical significance (e.g., grade level 
relevance, learning objectives, common student misconceptions, and Socratic tutor prompts).

This layer is strictly metadata-driven and contains no runtime or physics-stepping logic.

ARCHITECTURE & SCALABILITY
--------------------------
1. Unified Concepts Dictionary: Provides a central registry (`CONCEPT_LIBRARY`) containing 
   learning targets, age-appropriate explanations, and common student errors.
2. Property-to-Concept Binding: Standardizes how specific properties (e.g., `physics.mass`)
   translate to pedagogical terms across different simulations (e.g., "Inertial Mass").
3. Anti-Gravity & Emerging Physics Ready: Allows adding new concepts like "Anti-Gravity" 
   or "Quantum Mechanics" by registering a new entry without refactoring any core pipelines.
